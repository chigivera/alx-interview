# Pascal's Triangle

This project involves creating a function that generates Pascal's Triangle up to a specified number of rows `n`.

## Task

The task is to implement a function `pascal_triangle(n)` that returns a list of lists of integers representing Pascal's Triangle of `n`. The function should return an empty list if `n` is less than or equal to 0.

## How to Run the Script

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
2. Save the script `0-pascal_triangle.py` to your desired directory.
3. Make the script executable by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   chmod +x 0-pascal_triangle.py
